A functional fully on-chain dice poker game - sufficient for performance issues monitoring, but some broken game logic.

Polkadot Contract:
0x1ce43d3e45303569bafaba4c4ddef9baf1d7a73f

Full dice poker contract not deployable on Polkadot: size of this transaction is too large: it is 106815 while the max is 49152
Max init code size of 49152 is not sufficient. Westend Asset Hubâ€™s EVM pallet enforces it strictly.
